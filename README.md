# Linear_Regression
- In this Reprository i have implemented linear regression.<br>
- At first i have prepared the csv file containg the dataset which includes the dependent and independent variable in data.csv.<br>
- Now i have created a jupyter notebook which has all the necessary library imported.<br>
- The sklearn library contains the LinearRegression function in it.<br>
- After this step we predict the ouctcomes by giving the dependent variable.
