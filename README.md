# Linear Regression Model Implementation

This repository showcases the implementation of a simple Linear Regression model using Python's `scikit-learn` library. The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the `data.csv` file. The main implementation is in the `Model.py` file, and a Jupyter notebook (`Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb`) is provided for a detailed walkthrough.

## Files and Structure

- **Model.py:**
  - Contains the implementation of the Linear Regression model.
  - Imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset from `data.csv`.
  - Utilizes the `LinearRegression` function from `scikit-learn` for model training.
  - Generates predictions based on the input data.

- **data.csv:**
  - CSV file containing the dataset with dependent and independent variables.

- **Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb:**
  - Jupyter notebook providing a step-by-step guide to the implementation.
  - Includes explanations, visualizations, and code for model training and prediction.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-model.git
   cd linear-regression-model
   ```

2. Run the `Model.py` script or explore the Jupyter notebook (`Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb`) to understand the implementation and make predictions.

   ```bash
   python Model.py
   ```

3. Experiment with the dataset and tweak the model parameters for different scenarios.
